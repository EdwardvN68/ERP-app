  <h1>Head of IT – Emergency Response Role</h1>

  <h2>Activation</h2>
  <p>The Head of IT is activated during any Medium or High-level emergency requiring data protection, secure communications, or IT infrastructure support. This includes support for the EMT, remote access provisioning, data safeguarding, and forensic readiness.</p>
  <p>Refer to ERP Section 3.6.12 – Head of IT.</p>

  <h2>Core Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure the continued functioning and security of all IT systems supporting the EMT and response operations.</li>
    <li>Immediately quarantine data and devices related to the affected aircraft, crew, or operations. This includes computers, tablets, radios, mobile phones, and personal drives.</li>
    <li>Assist in securing and isolating access to the flight crew’s email accounts, company login credentials, and system audit trails.</li>
    <li>Coordinate with the Director of Quality and Legal Advisor for data retrieval, evidence preservation, and forensic imaging.</li>
    <li>Restrict access to sensitive data systems to only essential personnel.</li>
    <li>Provide the EMT with secure communication channels including encrypted email, access-controlled file sharing, and backup voice systems.</li>
    <li>Restore or reroute critical IT services if existing systems become compromised.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ERP References</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Section 3.6.12 – Head of IT</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Phase-Based Duties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phase 1 (0–60 min):</strong> Receive confirmation of activation from EMT Chair or Accountable Manager. Quarantine all relevant IT systems and personal devices associated with the flight. Disable non-essential access to sensitive systems and notify IT Security. Provide EMT access to secure communication platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 2 (1–4 hrs):</strong> Initiate forensic backup of affected systems in coordination with Quality and Legal. Monitor all internal systems for attempted unauthorized access. Maintain communication system continuity for EMT use.</li>
    <li><strong>Phase 3 (4+ hrs):</strong> Provide IT support to Emergency Call Centre and Family Assistance Team if activated. Document all security actions taken for post-event audit. Begin restoration of services or workarounds as recovery phase begins.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cautions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not permit any deletion or modification of potentially relevant data.</li>
    <li>Do not delay system lockdowns—quarantine takes priority over convenience.</li>
    <li>Avoid assumptions about system security—verify and log every action.</li>
    <li>Do not use unsecured platforms for EMT communications during an active event.</li>
  </ul>
