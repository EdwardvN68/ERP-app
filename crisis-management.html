  <h1>Crisis Management Service Provider (Go Crisis)</h1>

  <h2>Role Context (Training Overview)</h2>
  <p>
    Go Crisis is an external crisis management service provider that may be engaged to support Abu Dhabi Aviation
    during significant emergencies. The provider supports the Emergency Management Team (EMT) by providing
    specialist crisis management capability within the scope agreed between ADA and the service provider.
  </p>

  <h2>Activation (ERP-Aligned Awareness)</h2>
  <p>
    Activation and use of Go Crisis is controlled through EMT leadership and must be aligned to the Emergency Response Plan (ERP).
    This page is training-focused and provides role awareness only.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Responsibilities (Explained for Training)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide specialist crisis management support as directed by EMT leadership.</li>
    <li>Support crisis communication and coordination activities within agreed scope.</li>
    <li>Support welfare and assistance functions where requested and appropriate.</li>
    <li>Operate only within the contractual scope and under EMT direction.</li>
    <li>Support post-event recovery activities as required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>ERP References</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Section 3.6.17 – Crisis Management Service Provider (Go Crisis)</li>
    <li>Appendix A.1 – Crisis Management Service Provider Agreement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cautions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not act or communicate externally outside EMT direction and agreed scope.</li>
    <li>Do not rely on unverified information.</li>
    <li>Ensure activities remain traceable and appropriate for post-event review.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Final Note:</strong>
    Go Crisis provides specialist crisis support capability; however, ADA retains overall control of emergency response through the EMT.
